# Lifi Users Profile

This set of files, contain the notebooks, data and SQL and Python scripts used to create my submission to the LiFi Community Analytics Contest. It contains two notebooks: A presentation notebook and a methodology notebook. 

The methodology notebook shows all the Python and SQL code and describes in more detail the process and reasoning behind the creation of the presentation. There is also a folder for each of data, python scripts, and  SQL scripts used in the project. This is done both for validation and to instruct those interested in blockchain analysis as to my processes (and the contest requires it!)

The "Li.Fi-users-profile.ipynb" notebook is the main presentation and is intended for a general web3 audience.
